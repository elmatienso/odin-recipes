                                        The Tamal is an importat dish that is eaten in many regions of the country. But mostly regions like
                                        Tolima, Boyacá and Santander. This is my favorite of the list to be honest. This ish is pretty interesting
                                        because of its versatility, here we eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner and in special dates like christmas.
                                        <br>
                                        Here in Colombia we have 7 types of Tamales, it depends of the city that is prepared in. It could be Cúcuta, Antioquia or Bogotá.

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Soak the corn for 3 days changing the water daily, once the days go by, grind the corn.</li>
                                        <li>Marinate the chicken with salt, cumin and pepper. Cook the bacon leather and the pork rib in 6 cups of water with a little salt for 20 minutes, reserve the broth. Mix the ground corn with 3 cups of the broth and strain it.</li>
                                        <li>In the fat of the bacon, sauté the onion, garlic and annatto, for approximately 10 minutes, to all this mixture add the cooked rice, the peas and the corn, stir well and let it rest for an hour.</li>
                                        <li>To assemble the tamale, grease a banana leaf, place a bed of dough and put a little chicken, bacon, pork rib, potato, carrot and egg, place another layer of dough on top, collect the tips and edges of the leaves and tie them with the rope very well so that when cooking they do not come loose.</li>
                                        <li>Put to cook in the broth and water that covers them for 3 hours with the pot covered, over medium heat.</li>
