                                        The Tamal is an importat dish that is eaten in many regions of the country. But mostly regions like
                                        Tolima, Boyacá and Santander. This is my favorite of the list to be honest. This ish is pretty interesting
                                        because of its versatility, here we eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner and in special dates like christmas.

                                        Here in Colombia we have 7 types of Tamales, it depends of the city that is prepared in. It could be Cúcuta, Antioquia or Bogotá.
